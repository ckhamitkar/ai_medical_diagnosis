## 📌 Project Goals

- Apply machine learning and deep learning techniques to medical diagnosis problems
- Understand model evaluation metrics specific to healthcare
- Explore bias, sensitivity, specificity, and ethical considerations in medical AI
- Gain hands-on experience with real-world medical datasets

---

## 🧠 Key Topics Covered

- Medical image analysis (e.g., X-rays, MRI)
- Binary and multi-class disease classification
- Model evaluation metrics:
  - Accuracy
  - Sensitivity (Recall)
  - Specificity
  - ROC-AUC
- Handling class imbalance in medical datasets
- Interpreting results in a clinical context
